    <p>The Reading Recollections Mobile Applications allows users to track the authors and books they have read.  Users can add an author and then add books written by
    that author.  They are able to view all authors they've uploaded.  They can click on an author name and see author details, as well as all the books that author has
    written that they've uploaded.  Users can edit or delete authors or books easily.  They can also sort according to their preferences, or search for specific items.</p>

    <p>The application is designed to be simple and intuitive.  The power is in the hands of the reader.  They choose how much or how little information they want to add.  
    They choose how their information is sorted and displayed.  The application runs offline and all information is kept private.  It is stored locally in a simple database 
    on the user's device.</p>
